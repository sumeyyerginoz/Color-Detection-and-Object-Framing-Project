# Color-Detection-and-Object-Framing-Project
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect and track objects of a specific color in real-time video, and frames them with a rectangle.

#Installation

To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 and OpenCV installed on your system. You can install OpenCV by running the following command:


pip install opencv-python
#Usage

To run the program, simply run the color_detection.py file in your Python environment. The program will automatically detect objects of the color specified in the HSV_color_range variable, and frame them with a rectangle.

You can adjust the color range by modifying the values in the HSV_color_range variable. The program will detect all colors within the specified range.
